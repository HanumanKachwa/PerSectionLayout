PerSectionLayout
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sync/PerSectionLayout.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sync/PerSectionLayout)

Custom collection view layout, inspired by PSTCollectionView and RTFlowLayout (https://github.com/radianttap/RTFlowLayout)

Setup
-----

PerSectionLayout uses *cocoapods* to manage the iOS dependencies and *xcpretty* to make the output of the command line *xcodebuild* readable. There is a *Gemfile* with the ruby dependencies for bundler to use.

* `cd PerSectionLayout`
* `bundle install`
* `make test`
